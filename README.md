•	Git Repo Link  https://github.com/bvmraj/LearnersAcademy.git
•	The folder is LearnerAcademy
•	In my project I had used Hibernate to access the database and it is developed using Maven Dependency (it’s Maven Project).

Background of the problem statement:

Learner’s Academy is a school that has an online management system. The system keeps track of its classes, subjects, students, and teachers. It has a back-office application with a single administrator login.

 

The administrator can:

	● Set up a master list of all the subjects for all the classes
	● Set up a master list of all the teachers
	● Set up a master list of all the classes
	● Assign classes for subjects from the master list
	● Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)
	● Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)
     

There will be an option to view a Class Report which will show all the information about the class, such as the list of students, subjects, and teachers
     
The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible.
